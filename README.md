# TNID Dummy

The simplest code I could think of, to let you retrieve some data from GraphQL

99.9% of people won't need this, and will start with Apollo or similar.

For me... I'm in the 0.1% :)

## Getting started

* Get the client ID/secrets from company secrets page (https://app.staging.v2.tnid.com/company/client-secrets)

* Rename `dot.env.sample` to `.env`

* Replace the ??? with the ID/secret from the page above

* Run `node index.js`

And it _should_ give you a list of companies.
